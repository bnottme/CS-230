1.Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The company The Gaming Room wanted to expand their game on Android to other platforms and improve the overall user experience of the game.

2.What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I did particularly well in explaining the software requirements and specific design constraints while developing and making recommendations for The Gaming Room and what routes to take for the development of Draw It or Lose It.

3.What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through a design document helped me develop code by thinking about the software on a deeper level and how to make all the requirements The Gaming Room required.

4.If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one piece, I would redo the evaluation to clarify and add further information about each topic.

5.How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I thought about myself as the end user and what I would like if I were a Draw It or Lose It, player. It's important to consider users when designing software because they will be using it daily, and not considering them could lead to a drop in users.


6.How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When designing software, it's important to consider the company's requirements and the user's experience and record this information by documenting it.
